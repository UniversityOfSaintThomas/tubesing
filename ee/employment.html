<!--
<B>I am currently hiring for Lab Technician / Logistical Assistant position/s for summer 2012. </B>
-->
<B> Currently there are no positions available for Fall 2012. </B>
	<P>

	Common positions in ENGR Labs:
	
	<UL>
	<LI>Lab Technician (EE or ME)
		<UL>
	
		<LI>The job can be roughly 10-40 hours per week, depending on the needs of the department and availability of the student.
		<LI>The ideal candidate for this position is an EE or ME student (depending on the position), second-year or higher status in the ENGR program who has completed 230 and/or 240 or is taking them now. A ME student who is interested in EE and has taken 350 may also qualify.
		<LI>Other candidates may be considered depending on experience and interests, so if you're at all interested please stop by and see the EE lab manager in LL20.
		<P>
	
		
		</UL> 
		
<B>For all UST ENGR Lab positions:</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>The requirements are to be an EE/ME student (or close to it), second year or higher for some positions, with interest and aptitude in technical work to support the educational objectives of the UST EE program. We are not necessarily looking for highly advanced skills and/or knowledge... more critical are work ethic, eagerness to learn, and leadership potential. Working in the department is a good way to become more involved, build relationships with department personnel, and it makes a good complement to your studies.<P>
		<P>
		<LI>We use the campus standard  <I>Technical</I> and <I>Academic</I> <A HREF="http://www.stthomas.edu/hr/studentemployment/payrates.html">pay rates</A> as a guide in setting wages, but each case depends on a variety of factors so this is only a rough guide.
	<P>
    	<LI>Please fill out <A HREF="ENGR_Student_App.doc">this application</A> (word doc) to help me understand more about you, your interests, and your experience. The second page is a schedule form that will help me get a picture of when you might be available for regular duties. Bring it to me when you have it completed and we'll talk about the possibilities. I can be found in OSS LL20, across from the vending machines in the ENGR dungeon. [Shall we call it "The Dungeneer?"]
    <P>
    	<LI>General info about student work, including basic wage structure and other details, can be found at the human resources <A HREF="http://www.stthomas.edu/hr/studentemployment/default.html">Student Employment page</A>.
