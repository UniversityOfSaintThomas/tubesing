<B>GPS Instructions:</B>
<UL>
<LI>For coordinates, use this: <B>44.940, -93.194</b>
<LI>Use this address for GPS directions: <B>40 S. Cretin Ave, St Paul MN, 55105</B>. You will have to enter it manually, and note that it is S cretin ave, not Cretin Ave S (yes, it does matter, for some reason)
<LI>Do NOT believe the search results for St Thomas and use the recommended 2115 Summit address, it will take you to the wrong place.
</UL>
<P>

</BR>

<B>From <A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=40+S.+Cretin+Ave%2C+St+Paul+MN%2C+55105&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b">Cretin & Grand intersection:</A> </B> &nbsp; where Grand Ave makes a T into Cretin Ave (and becomes the south campus driveway)

	<UL>

	<LI>Go west into the south campus driveway.
