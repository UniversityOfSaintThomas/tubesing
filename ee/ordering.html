<B>Order Placement Guidelines for UST ENGR/EE Labs</B>
	<P>
	Students who need to place orders or project parts (for class, senior design, etc.) should follow these guidelines. Read the entire instructions before placing your order. 
		<OL>
		<LI><B>Shop wisely</B> 
				<P>
			<UL>
			<LI>Check multiple vendors to be sure you find your item/s at good prices with reasonable shipping charges. 
			<LI>Confirm that your items are in stock and ready to ship.
			<LI>Check here for ideas on <A HREF="http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/tubesing/ee/vendors.html">where to find electronic parts</A>. Preferred vendors that have quick and easy ordering and shipping are Digikey and Amazon. Grainger and McMaster are good too.
			</UL>
		<P>
		<LI><B>Assemble the information I need to place the order</B> 
			<UL>
			<P>
			<LI>Create a shopping cart online
			<P>
				<UL>
				<LI>Some vendors have shopping carts you can save and forward to me directly. 
					<UL>
					<LI>Digikey: Enter your class/team number in the "Customer Reference" Box then send me the "Web ID" and "Access ID" from your order.
					<LI>McMaster: Enter your class/team number in the "Purchase Order" box and send me the requisition by clicking "Forward" in the upper right corner link bar.
					</UL>
					<P>
				<LI>Print it to a pdf or take a screenshot for inclusion in your email request. YES do this even if you're using one of the direct methods above, it allows me to confirm that I am looking at the right order. 
				</UL>
				<P>
			<LI>If you can't create a shopping cart, send me a spreadsheet.
			</UL>
		<P>
		<LI><B>Email me the information I need to place the order</B> 
			<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><B>All</B> order-related communications <B>must</B> include the following info (in addition to anything mentioned above):
				<P>
				<UL>
				<LI>In the Subject line of the email: 
					<UL>
					<LI>Team number and Class name (Senior Design, ENGR331, etc)
					<LI>Vendor you are ordering from
					</UL>
					<P>
				<LI>In the Email: 
					<UL>
					<LI>Your name
					<LI>Team number and Class name (Senior Design, ENGR331, etc)
					<LI>Brief written summary of your order (description of items you are ordering). Yes this is necessary even if you are including an attachment or shopping cart access code/link.
					<LI>Complete contact info for the vendor if it's not on my <A HREF="http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/tubesing/ee/vendors.html">preferred list</A>.
					</UL>
				</UL>
			<P>
			<LI>Specify how you would  like it to be shipped. Be reasonable. Do not ask for rush processing or delivery unless you truly need it and will follow up promptly.
			<P>
			<LI>Include any other special instructions or information I would need to place the order.
			<P>
			<LI>I will confirm by reply email when the order has been placed. If you do not get a confirmation from me then assume it did not get ordered. In this case you should follow up with me after a reasonable time to be sure there wasn't a problem.
			</UL>	
		<P>
		<LI><B>Follow up properly when the order arrives</B>
			<UL>
			<P>
			<LI>I will contact you when the order arrives <I>if you have followed my instructions in part 3 above</I>. If you were sloppy in part 3 then I may have trouble finding the details and may not be able to contact you easily. Or I may not have even placed the order.
			<P>
			<LI>When you receive notice that it has arrived, pick it up promptly or reply to make alternate arrangements.
			<P>
			<LI>If you need to access the order immediately when it arrives and I have not yet had a chance to check the order in, you must verify that all items on the packing list have arrived in the package, note that on the packing list, and make sure I get the packing list. This should only be done in extreme cases that truly warrant this urgency.
			</UL>

	<P>	
Things to keep in mind:
	<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>I place several orders for parts for various people every day. 
	<LI>I will NOT remember each person's order and details about it between when it is placed and when it arrives.
	<LI>It is important for you to follow the documentation instructions above so that we can get the order in your hands easily and effectively reconcile the billing.
	<LI>I have other duties aside from placing orders, so... do not wait until the last minute to place your order because I may not be available or able to place it instantly. 
	
	<LI>It takes time to receive and process an incoming order, so do not cut it so close that your order is arriving on the day you must have it.
